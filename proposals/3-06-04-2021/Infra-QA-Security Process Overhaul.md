name: Infrastructure, QA, and security improvement of process and addition to the current pipeline..
about: The current state of the developement and deployment pipeline is not optimal for scalation and testing purposes. Right now, we are missing security tests and spending a lot of resources into manual test, with this overhaul, we want to automate as much as possible so we can deploy secured and tested versions of pocket faster than current times.

## Proposal
### Detailed Summary of Proposal
The team will develop a new pipeline for development, push and deploy of features to pocket core and pocket js. 

Automation of security and QA tests in addition to the deploy of the multiple deployment options for pocket core is a must right now, as those are right now being done manually, they could become a problem in the future as our protocol gets more complex.

### Estimated Timeline
Between 6 and 8 weeks.

**Evidence and Justification for this timeline:**

- One week of analysis.
- Four weeks of development.
- Three weeks of testing.

The change will change completely the pipeline and will be develop from the ground to a new more improved pipeline following better guidelines and learning from our past experiences of developing and deploying tested and stable features.

### How to test functionality?
To properly test the changes we are going to perform a full regression testing of every feature available right now. But also we are going to integrate those tests inside the new pipeline, turning this, into the pipeline test itself.
### Project Abstractions

### QA Planification
The three weeks of the milestone, every team will be testing the new pipeline with the integration of all the develop pieces, this will be an organization effort as the result of this will also be reflected in the effectiveness of the new process of development and deploy.
