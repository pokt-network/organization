### Project Purpose
The purpose of the project is to generate evidence as to the Load capacity of the Pocket Core software, both in total nodes in the network, as well as relay capacity.
### Key Goals Of Project
- Document evidence of the Pocket Core 0.6.0 version running in a network with the following characteristics:
    - 5,000 Nodes in the network.
    - Network must be processing upwards of 4,166,666 Relays per session (1 hr sessions).
    - The test must be ran for at least 5 hours (1 session and 1 proof period).
- Document evidence of the Pocket Core 0.6.0 version running in a network with the following characteristics:
    - 10,000 Nodes in the network.
    - Network must be processing upwards of 4,166,666 Relays per session (1 hr sessions).
    - The test must be ran for at least 5 hours (1 session and 1 proof period).
- Document the PNS software and it's usage.
