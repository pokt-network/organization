## Report of Immediate Action
### Detailed Summary of executed Immediate Action
Multiple users reported some issues on the Wallet and that the Faucet was failing to send transactions, this lead to the Ecosystem team to suggest some changes on the wallet and 
a fix for the Faucet, adding to add a user reported an issue with his/her wallet on production, which increased the overall dedicated scope.

### Evidence and Justification of the need for the Immediate Action:**
The Wallet issues were affecting the community trust in Pocket, multiple issues like missing transactions from the account details, failing send transactions and failed import account without the proper warning.
