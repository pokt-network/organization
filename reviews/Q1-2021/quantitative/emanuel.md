### General Notes

1. Support Tasks are not documented in any audit trail, so there's 0 visibility, contributing to this report indicating such a unsatisfactory amount of work done during the quarter.
2. Helped out with the RC-0.6.0 milestone by filling out the QA Certification documentation, even though it wasn't assigned to him.
