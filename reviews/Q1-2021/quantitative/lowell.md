## Review
**Points Accumulated Lead Since The Last Review**

[N/A] Point system not implemented yet.

**Number Of Milestones Lead And Completed Since The Last Review**

Notes:
1. Unstake Legacy Node milestone document had wrong title and wrong milestone lead (title was wrong).
2. Even though the work was done, the audit trail was not completed correctly.
3. The milestones worked on should not have taken the entire engineer's bandwith for the entire quarter, meaning there's work that was not reported nor documented anywhere, or the pace was unsatisfactory.

**Number Of Projects Lead And Completed Since The Last Review**

Notes: 
1. Projects were copy/pasted from another milestone, so no clear audit trail.

**Number Of Issues Lead And Completed Since The Last Review**

1. Because of improper project audit trail, no issues can be attributed to this engineer.

**Number Of Organization Tasks Lead And Completed Since The Last Review**


**Number Of Community Tasks Lead And Completed Since The Last Review**
