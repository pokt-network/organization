Though I haven't directly worked with Julio, I've seen his work first hand and used the artifacts he works on. Good quality all around, just not exemplar with the documentation. I'd like to see some improvements on that front.

This guy always delivers quickly. I've had many asks of him, and he always goes above and beyond. I really appreciate his urgency.

Couldn't find any public messages in discord on his behalf. I haven't seen him be a leader to the public like he is in private. Would love to see some improvement on this front.

Julio is a self starter. He knows how to step up, speak up, and deliver. Julio has an active contribution mindset, I just wish he'd be a bit more active to learn the protocol and develop on that front.

A good communicator with a bad internet connection :) In all seriousness he knows how to communicate well. He speaks only when he has something to say and he makes his points crystal clear.

I gave Julio a 10, not because there's no room for improvement, but because 'relatively' he is the leader of the pack. Active participation on all fronts, including but not limited to the organization repo, organization formation discussions, and brainstorming hours. 

**Numerical Rating of Leadership Qualities** 

Rate this peer as a Leader. 1 being a follower, 10 being a true captain.

Julio stepped up in the last quarter. As one of the youngest guys on the team, it's amazing how much confidence he delivers. I personally think he has even more potential to grow and he should push himself even more to be not only a leader of the company but an executive force.

**Numerical Rating of Non-Specialty Knowledge** 

Rate this peer's knowledge outside their specialty. 1 being an isolated specialist, 10 being a well-rounded specialist

7

**Detailed Description of Non-Specialty Knowledge** 

Rate this peer's knowledge outside their specialty. Justify your rating above.

He knows a lot about engineering in general, not only Infra. His protocol knowledge is a bit weak and he could improve there.


### General Notes
The review says it all, he's a very impressive member of this team and he flourished the previous quarter.
