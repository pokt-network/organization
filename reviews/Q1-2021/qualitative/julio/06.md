**Numerical Rating of Identification as a Community Member** 

[5]

**Detailed Description Identification as a Community Member** 

I think Julio struggles to feel part of the community, based off the fact of him interacting with the community only when asked.

**Numerical Rating of Identification as a Self Starter With an Active Contribution Mindset** 

[8]

**Detailed Description Identification as a Self Starter With an Active Contribution Mindset** 

Julio has embeded himself in almost all conversations and workflows of the organization, from processes to different milestones that he himself was not a part of. However he has done little to push new ideas to fuition.

**Numerical Rating of Communication Skills** 

[8]

**Detailed Description of Communication Skills** 

Julio's communication style is very honest and concise. However he tends to be a little unnaproachable to those he's communicating for the first time.

**Numerical Rating of Identification as a Pocket Network Organization Member** 

[9]

**Detailed Description of Identification as a Pocket Network Organization Member** 

Julio is very interested in the organization working as intended, and has expressed so from brainstorming sessions about the organization itself, to calling out improvement opportunities. Only reason he doesn't get a 10 is because I haven't seen him rally support for improvement ideas of his own or others.

**Numerical Rating of Leadership Qualities** 

[7]

**Detailed Description of Leadership Qualities** 

I think Julio can rise to be a very effective leader of the organization, however he needs to learn how to rally support around his ideas and push them through to the goal line.

**Numerical Rating of Non-Specialty Knowledge** 

[8]

**Detailed Description of Non-Specialty Knowledge** 

Julio seems to be gaining knowledge of the inner workings of the protocol, however still shows very little knowledge on the application client side of the network.

### General Notes
Julio is on-route to becoming one of the most effective leaders of the organization, with sharp observations and end to end understanding of what good engineering needs to be.
