He's the standard of quality within the whole organization. He's not allowing anyone and anything to step below our good standards.

**Numerical Rating of Speed Of Work** 

[8]

**Detailed Description Rating of Speed Of Work** 

I think, understandably, the speed is one of his weaknesses due to the details of his position. He tries to be on top of everything, so he's not able to be very fast on any topics.

He's always providing Support and knowledge to the comminity. Always willing to have the community happy so that we can all be happy. In his own words: "Si ustedes ganan, yo gano".

Simply the standard of a PNI member. Takes care of PNI, invest time in PNI approach that are always in favor of PNI's. Motivates and guides others to feel identified as PNI members. Willing always to sacrifice and give almost everything for PNI.

He's the perfect example of a great leader. Word.

**Numerical Rating of Non-Specialty Knowledge** 

[10]

**Detailed Description of Non-Specialty Knowledge** 

As the CTO requires, this guy is very knowledgeable of many topics on engineering and maybe non-engineering. He's very meticilous and curious, very investigative and never settles to be an ignorant. He's the perfect CTO.

### General Notes
Never change the attitude, as personal experience, it motivates the rest of the team. Believe me.
