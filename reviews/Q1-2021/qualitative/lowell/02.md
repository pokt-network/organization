**Numerical Rating of Identification as a Community Member** 

[3]

**Detailed Description Identification as a Community Member** 

I feel like Lowell demonstrates more interest in the crypto industry as a whole, rather than in the Pocket Network community specifically.

**Numerical Rating of Identification as a Self Starter With an Active Contribution Mindset** 

[6]

**Detailed Description Identification as a Self Starter With an Active Contribution Mindset** 

I feel like at the infrastructure level of the organization needs, Lowell knows what to push forward and what to improve, but somehow lacks the overall context of the network and community as a whole to push for those efforts.

**Numerical Rating of Communication Skills** 

[3]

**Detailed Description of Communication Skills** 

I think Lowell could use improving his communication skills, both written and verbal, which would allow him to communicate more easily with the community and other teammates. He's prone to miscommunication and needs things repeated back to him every once in a while.

**Numerical Rating of Identification as a Pocket Network Organization Member** 

[5]

**Detailed Description of Identification as a Pocket Network Organization Member** 

Sometimes Lowell seems pretty active and other times he just seems to go with the flow.

**Numerical Rating of Leadership Qualities** 

[6]

**Detailed Description of Leadership Qualities** 

Lowell is a leader with his technical infrastructure knowledge and continously keeps pushing the ball forward to improve things, however he could use expanding his role and leadership capabilities to other parts of the network and the community.

**Numerical Rating of Non-Specialty Knowledge** 

[3]

**Detailed Description of Non-Specialty Knowledge** 

Lowell lacks both knowledge about the protocol inner-workings and the client side development, having failed to provision correctly configured infra because of not knowing how to test.

### General Notes
With a push on the communication skills, and a little bit of consistency on execution, Lowell already has the innate qualities to be a leader in the organization.
