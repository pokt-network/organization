Lowell seems to know what he's doing. He always has a way to understand the task at hand and deliver adequate work. I think his work could be QA'd higher. Even though it's not my specialty, I've experienced issues first hand with the his work. A bit more care overall would go a long way into improving this 7 to a 10.

Rate the speed of the work delivered by this peer. Justify your rating above.

From my perspective, Lowell doesn't seem to be a bottleneck in terms of speed. I've seen him pull all nighters for work needed to be done. My main concern with him is his nocturnal nature and getting a speedy response from him in the mornings.

Lowell doesn't participate in the non-private discord AFAIK. Being so knowledgeable, there's not much of an excuse to share his knowledge with everyone There's much room for improvement here across the board.

Rate this peer as a Self Starter. Justify your rating above.

I wouldn't describe Lowell as a self starter, but I would describe him as curious and has an active contribution mindset. He seems very interested in his work and seems to be looking for ways to improve the infra.

**Detailed Description of Communication Skills** 

Rate this peer's communication skills. Justify your rating above.

Lowell is an okay communicator. Very funny guy, but comes off as a bit quiet when I know he has much to say. I'd hope that he learns to improve his communication a bit for the betterment of the project.

Being the most senior member of the infra specialists, I wish there was more participation in the organization level activities across the board. He seems quite invisible on the organization repo and doesn't seem to be that interested in improving the organization. 

**Numerical Rating of Leadership Qualities** 

Rate this peer as a Leader. 1 being a follower, 10 being a true captain.

**Detailed Description of Leadership Qualities** 

Rate this peer as a Leader. Justify your rating above.

He steps up occasionally and he drives a lot of value. I've seen him be a liason to PNF and help others with tasks needed. However, I would never guess he was one of the first employees of the company. He has many good ideas and perspectives and I'd like to see a lot more improvements on the leadership front. 

**Numerical Rating of Non-Specialty Knowledge** 

Rate this peer's knowledge outside their specialty. 1 being an isolated specialist, 10 being a well-rounded specialist

2

**Detailed Description of Non-Specialty Knowledge** 

Rate this peer's knowledge outside their specialty. Justify your rating above.

He knows a lot in his specialty, but he's as guilty as anyone when it comes to siloing. I wish he'd show more interest in his non-domain subjects.


### General Notes
Lowell is a great contributor, person, and engineer. Though there is improvement to be made, I respect him a lot and wish to see some changes be made.
