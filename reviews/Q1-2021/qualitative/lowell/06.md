Great quality of work, sometimes miss it in a couple of details, but nothing major.

I think that due to the hotness of his position, he's speed gets considerably compromised to quickly deliver.

Have seen him interacting with the community just a few times.

**Numerical Rating of Identification as a Self Starter With an Active Contribution Mindset**

**Detailed Description Identification as a Self Starter With an Active Contribution Mindset** 

In my opinion, he's a good self starter and contributes a lot. But sometimes his time management skills are not the best, therefore could not perfectly handle this point.

**Numerical Rating of Communication Skills** 

[7]

**Detailed Description of Communication Skills** 

I believe that would be great to have him speaking up his thoughts with knowledge more within our calls. Interacting more in chats as well, regarding several topics.

**Numerical Rating of Identification as a Pocket Network Organization Member** 

[8]

**Detailed Description of Identification as a Pocket Network Organization Member** 

I feel he can do a bit better as a PNI member, and interact more for the organization. It's really needed since I know he has the potential.

**Detailed Description of Leadership Qualities** 

He has built a great team, and leads it in the right proper manner to match the organization's needs.

**Numerical Rating of Non-Specialty Knowledge**

**Detailed Description of Non-Specialty Knowledge** 

I have not seen him colaborating outside of infra, maybe due to his very tight agenda; but have not felt he's dominant on many other topics.

He's a masterpiece on the organization, that could be really well shaped to our own positive purpose.
