## Review
**Numerical Rating of Quality Of Work** 

[10]

**Detailed Description Rating of Quality Of Work** 

The quality of the work it's great. Provides the features with very low level of errors and the error gap is very low. Very detailed and always thinking of almost every aspects of the software while developing.

**Numerical Rating of Speed Of Work** 

[10]

**Detailed Description Rating of Speed Of Work** 

RC-0.6.0 was practically ready while the handbook was being tuned up and finished. Started even when patching RC-0.5.2.9 and so on. Nothing else to add :)

**Numerical Rating of Identification as a Community Member** 


[9]

**Detailed Description Identification as a Community Member** 

He has improved a lot, but 2-4 months ago was a bit absent of community channels and support related tasks for community members, which is totally understandable as was focused on PNI/Engineering duties.

**Numerical Rating of Identification as a Self Starter With an Active Contribution Mindset** 


[10]

**Detailed Description Identification as a Self Starter With an Active Contribution Mindset** 

The pattern of self starting and active contribution mindset, always looking forward to propose enhancements not only to his team, but to the organization.

**Numerical Rating of Communication Skills** 

[10]

**Detailed Description of Communication Skills** 

Very communicative with his ideas. I notice he puts effort into being honest and clear, to avoid miscommunication and it's always willing to communicate effectively and fight for lack of communication within the team.

**Numerical Rating of Identification as a Pocket Network Organization Member** 


[10]

**Detailed Description of Identification as a Pocket Network Organization Member** 

Simply the standard of a PNI member. Takes care of PNI, invest time in PNI approach that are always in favor of PNI's. Motivates and guides others to feel identified as PNI members.

**Numerical Rating of Leadership Qualities** 

[9]

**Detailed Description of Leadership Qualities** 

Related to his identification as a PNI member quality, he simply shows with great example the quality of a leader who not only dictates the way, but goes alongside the team in the journey, working together and motivating who could be lacking of motivation at some point. Seems to be very knowledgable of his area and very capable of being a source of truth for his team's approaches.

The 9 comes from the decision of hardcoding the upgradeHeight to then end up making up dynamically, which turned a bit to be messy in the ending process of the milestone when the team was suggesting to make it dynamic since the beginning.

**Numerical Rating of Non-Specialty Knowledge** 

[9]

**Detailed Description of Non-Specialty Knowledge** 

Besides his blockchain engineering knowledge, I've seen him interact with other teams and showing himself willing to learn and tackle topics even out of his area. Seems like individual investigation is done on his side for those specialties so that he's not zeroed on other areas.



### General Notes
I consider himself a true leader, not only for his team, but for the whole organization. One of the pilars of the organization.
