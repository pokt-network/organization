It's a two way street, however it seems like Nelson works pretty strictly with the infra specialists. I'd look forward to more cross-pollination in the future.

Rate the quality of the work delivered by this peer. Justify your rating above.

The only deliverable I worked on that nelson touched was the Pocket Validator Stack in Pocket Core Deployments and the Naxsi package was commented out, but references to it were left in the deployment. Since this is seemingly the only work AFAIK that I'm familiar with, I can't rank higher than half marks.

It seems like Nelson is not a bottleneck in the infra deliverables, however I am shockingly unfamiliar with his development pace. I turned to the deployment repo trying to look for hints, but came up empty.

Nelson does not participate publicly in the discord AFAIK. I'd love to see him become a community member and lead the way.

**Detailed Description Identification as a Self Starter With an Active Contribution Mindset** 

Rate this peer as a Self Starter. Justify your rating above.

The most I know about nelson being a self starter is from the brainstorming sessions. He seems to have good ideas and isn't afraid to speak up if probed. I haven't noticed an active contribution mindset from him, rather a passive adequate level. I'd love to hear some high quality security recommendations from him and look for him to seek the opportunity to stamp his name in history and make Pocket Network as secure as it possibly can be.
**Numerical Rating of Communication Skills** 

Rate this peer's communication skills. 1 being completely inadequate, 10 being highest quality

Rate this peer's communication skills. Justify your rating above.

He communicates well and clearly, just not often enough. I'd love to see more engagement from him to better evaluate his communication skills.

**Numerical Rating of Identification as a Pocket Network Organization Member** 

Rate this peer as a Pocket Network Organization Member. 1 being a non-participant, 10 being very active and engaged.

**Detailed Description of Identification as a Pocket Network Organization Member** 

Rate this peer as a Pocket Network Organization Member. Justify your rating above

I don't see much reason to give him the points in this category. A general lack of presence in the organization and an invisibility in the organization repository. Much improvement can be made on this front. 

**Numerical Rating of Leadership Qualities** 

Rate this peer as a Leader. 1 being a follower, 10 being a true captain.

**Detailed Description of Leadership Qualities** 

Rate this peer as a Leader. Justify your rating above.

I think Nelson has the ability to be a leader, but I've never seen this in our working relationship. I'd love to see him step up and spread his knowledge, enable others to deliver the security that he seeks and knows.
**Numerical Rating of Non-Specialty Knowledge** 

Rate this peer's knowledge outside their specialty. 1 being an isolated specialist, 10 being a well-rounded specialist

2

**Detailed Description of Non-Specialty Knowledge** 

Rate this peer's knowledge outside their specialty. Justify your rating above.

AFAIK Nelson is not knowledgeable the specialties outside of his infra.
