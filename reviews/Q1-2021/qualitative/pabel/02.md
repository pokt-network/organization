Pabel is a good community member spearheading at times support for apps integration and community users that want to use

[7]

**Detailed Description of Communication Skills**

Rate this peer's communication skills. Justify your rating above.

I will rate Pabel communication as adequate and a bit brief, until lately it was kind of difficult to
know what Pabel was working on or to know what were his thoughts about things discussed if not asked directly.
I believe there is room for improvements as a better communication makes things easier for us all.

A bit related to the previous rated topic, Pabel is not that active and doesn't engage much in the open,
and i feel he has a lot of insight to offer to the organization.

I have seen Pabel being a leader when he had to do it, as a senior Pocket Organization member

Haven't had the opportunity to work directly with him outside his area of specialty

like helping with the original dashboard and wallet deployments.
