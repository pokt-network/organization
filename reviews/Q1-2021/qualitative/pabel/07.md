## Review
**Numerical Rating of Quality Of Work** 

[5]

**Detailed Description Rating of Quality Of Work** 

Pabel's work on the RC-0.6.0 release led to a delay in the release, and emergency work by Andrew and Luis to support the release.

**Numerical Rating of Speed Of Work** 

[5]

**Detailed Description Rating of Speed Of Work** 

Work done by Pabel on the RC-0.6.0 release was "code complete" on time, but wasn't properly tested leading up to delays.

**Numerical Rating of Identification as a Community Member** 

[5]

**Detailed Description Identification as a Community Member** 

Pabel is able to provide support, when asked most of the times, to developers trying direct integrations, however very little other community participation can be found.

**Numerical Rating of Identification as a Self Starter With an Active Contribution Mindset** 

[3]

**Detailed Description Identification as a Self Starter With an Active Contribution Mindset** 

This is one of Pabel's weaknesses, he needs to be able to come up with ideas, push them forward end to end and get them implemented, rolled out and communicated properly.

**Numerical Rating of Communication Skills** 

[5]

**Detailed Description of Communication Skills** 

Pabel's communication style is friendly and easygoing, but sometimes lacks the specificity and preciseness expected from an engineer.

**Numerical Rating of Identification as a Pocket Network Organization Member** 

[5]

**Detailed Description of Identification as a Pocket Network Organization Member** 

Pabel can go in and out, sometimes for long periods of time, not expressing and opinion or being aware of the organization state, just to come back later and ask basic questions to catch up.

**Numerical Rating of Leadership Qualities** 

[4]

**Detailed Description of Leadership Qualities** 

Pabel can lead within his specialty, after requirements are given to him, to push through an implementation, however shows little interest in leadership of large projects.

**Numerical Rating of Non-Specialty Knowledge** 

[3]

**Detailed Description of Non-Specialty Knowledge** 

Pabel is often times needed to be explained basic features of the system, both from the core client and infrastructure standpoints, which I believe limits his approach to the work he does within his own specialty.

### General Notes
If Pabel can transfer his easygoing nature and problem solving tenacity to a smarter workflow, assume more leadership opportunities and increase his participation in the community, he can become a better asset to the organization.
