It's a two way street, however it seems like Nelson works pretty strictly with the infra specialists. I'd look forward to more cross-pollination in the future.

The deliverables that Pabel executed on were not of the highest quality during the 6.0 JS milestone. I know some JS and the quality of the code was not impressive, rather seemingly adequate for the task.

On the milestone I collaborated with Pabel on, the deliverables were both high stakes and very late. I was not impressed with the pace of app solutions this quarter.

Pabel rarely participates in the public community discord, but 'relatively' he might be seen as average compared to other PNI members.

Barring the past week (after the 6.0 deliverables were late and finished). I saw little to no initiative coming from Pabel. As one of the founders of the company, I'd expect a lot more passion about the work. I think there's a lot of room for improvement here.

Pabel is an adequate communicator who doesn't respond timely to teammate messages. I think there's a lot of improvement to be had in this respect.

Pabel did not participate much during the organization phaseshift meetings. He's invisible on the org repo and shows a lack participation when it comes to being a member of the org.

**Detailed Description of Leadership Qualities** 

Rate this peer as a Leader. Justify your rating above.

On occasion I see Pabel trying to come off as a leader for his peers, but I think his impact on the company would be much better if he'd lead by example. You wouldn't really know that he's a founder of the company.

**Numerical Rating of Non-Specialty Knowledge** 

Rate this peer's knowledge outside their specialty. 1 being an isolated specialist, 10 being a well-rounded specialist

2

**Detailed Description of Non-Specialty Knowledge** 

Rate this peer's knowledge outside their specialty. Justify your rating above.

Pabel did not show to me much knowledge outside of his specialty. I'd like for him to have an aspiration for knowledge of all things pocket.
