**Detailed Description Rating of Quality Of Work** 

After executing a very thorough Functional Test project, several bugs were found by the development team, on top of a critical level issue. In the end, a gap in knowledge of the architecture and design of the software didn't allow for an effective QA strategy and execution.

Emanuel has served at the forefront of the technical support for the community and any technical issues raised, participating in the community often and effectively raising issues and sheparding community members to either solutions or evidence gathering for future improvements.

**Numerical Rating of Identification as a Self Starter With an Active Contribution Mindset**

Emanuel is inconsistent with being a self-starter, at times he's very driven and autonomous, and at times he isn't.

Emanuel's communication style is always cordial and on-point, he's usually very motivated and eager to help.

**Detailed Description of Identification as a Pocket Network Organization Member** 

Emanuel's active participation in the community and the organization, show that he's usually aware of what's going on, and he's able to always bring the community perspective to the organization, either by pointing out to evidence brought up, or straight up pain points.

**Numerical Rating of Leadership Qualities** 

[7]

**Detailed Description of Leadership Qualities** 

Emanuel can be a leader, usually when he's asked to. I believe if he can become more autonomous he will be able to grow as a leader.

**Numerical Rating of Non-Specialty Knowledge** 

[7]

**Detailed Description of Non-Specialty Knowledge** 

Emanuel is a jack of all trades, master of none. He's touched every part of the Pocket Network systems end to end, however he hasn't dug deeper into the architectures and designs.

### General Notes
Emanuel's ability to be watchful, product oriented and a well rounded engineer with great attention to detail can become a great asset to the organization, if he can consistently execute on those qualities and step up to lead without being asked to.
