I think Emanuel strives to go above and beyond with his deliverables. I was very impressed with his functional testing spreadsheet. However, I can't give him complete marks due to the big RC-0.6.0 QA miss.

I was not impressed with the pace Emanuel works at. Besides the functional tests and some mild support (should be outsourced to the rest of the organization and community anyway), I'm not sure he delivered anything else official.

Emanuel is all over the community discord, but is invisible on the community forum. I'd love to see some more participation in governance level activities. Relatively speaking, he's leading the pack as a community member.

I see a fire in Emanuel. I truly believe he has a good drive, a level head, and an active contribution mindset. However, I don't think he's even close to reach his potential (see leadership section)

Rate this peer's communication skills. 1 being completely inadequate, 10 being highest quality

Emanuel communicates clearly and effectively. I gave him a 9 / 10 because I think if he doesn't understand something, he needs to speak up quicker.

Emanuel is always in the brainstorming sessions. Emanuel participated greatly in the phaseshift discussion at the beginning of Q1. He merged his deliverables in the organization repo. He is a quality member, just needs to go the extra mile to get higher marks.

**Numerical Rating of Leadership Qualities** 

Rate this peer as a Leader. 1 being a follower, 10 being a true captain.

**Detailed Description of Leadership Qualities**

Emanuel just needs a bit more confidence in his knowledge. He is a good talent and understands people, users, and good QA practices well. I just haven't seen him demonstrate his leadership qualities. We all have a unique opportunity to step up, I'd love to see him take the reigns and lead the charge.

**Numerical Rating of Non-Specialty Knowledge** 

Rate this peer's knowledge outside their specialty. 1 being an isolated specialist, 10 being a well-rounded specialist

7

**Detailed Description of Non-Specialty Knowledge** 

Rate this peer's knowledge outside their specialty. Justify your rating above.

Overall, Emanuel is not afraid to step outside his specialty. He's got a ways to go, but I'd say most improved overall. Relatively speaking, he's leading the pack in effort.
