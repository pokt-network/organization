Emanuel is always available for the community, trying to help as much as he can,

I feel Emanuel has good knowledge in areas like user experience and testing automation,
lately he is been diving more and more in other areas outside testing and support and always brings great ideas to the table ,
but there is still room for improvement as i feel he is still focused a bit much on the testing side.
