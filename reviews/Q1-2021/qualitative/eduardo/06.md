## Review
**Numerical Rating of Quality Of Work** 

[3]

**Detailed Description Rating of Quality Of Work** 

Eduardo's work on RC-0.6.0 was deficient and had to be reworked by other teammates in the end.

**Numerical Rating of Speed Of Work** 

[1]

**Detailed Description Rating of Speed Of Work** 

Eduardo seems very slow on the Milestone for the new Transaction Indexer for Pocket Core, with very little to no work to show for it.

**Numerical Rating of Identification as a Community Member** 

[5]

**Detailed Description Identification as a Community Member** 

On conversation Eduardo's mindset seems to be focused on what's good for the network, but this doesn't translate in community action and/or engagement.

**Numerical Rating of Identification as a Self Starter With an Active Contribution Mindset** 

[3]

**Detailed Description Identification as a Self Starter With an Active Contribution Mindset** 

On conversation, Eduardo seems to propose and assigns responsability to himself, but rarely executes on it. One such instance is that on several ocassions he's advocated for better organization processes and documentation, but has done very little in pushing those efforts forward.

**Numerical Rating of Communication Skills** 

[8]

**Detailed Description of Communication Skills** 

Eduardo is a very good communicator, usually on-point and precise with a good sense of humor that makes him approachable.

**Numerical Rating of Identification as a Pocket Network Organization Member** 

[5]

**Detailed Description of Identification as a Pocket Network Organization Member** 

I think Eduardo was very outspoken during the Phaseshift process that kickstarted the new organization, but has ever since pushed that ideology into action.

**Numerical Rating of Leadership Qualities** 

[3]

**Detailed Description of Leadership Qualities** 

Eduardo has tried to assign responsability, and has been able to push for his ideas and gather support, however in the execution front has come up short. One good instance was getting enough support for the Project Management and Audit Trail Enhancement Proposal, however in other instances such as the Transaction Indexer milestone has fallen short on execution.

**Numerical Rating of Non-Specialty Knowledge** 

[8]

**Detailed Description of Non-Specialty Knowledge** 

Eduardo is pretty well versed in infrastructure knowledge, but could learn a little bit more of the client side process.

### General Notes
Eduardo needs to step up his execution skills and put his ideas to execution.
