Eduardo work is of good quality, i have witness some really good ideas and implementations
and he is always eager to do things in an elegant fashion if he is sold on the idea.
 On the other hand on some cases i feel some task end up having some issues because
 of lack of attention to details.

**Detailed Description Rating of Speed Of Work**

Rate the speed of the work delivered by this peer. Justify your rating above.

Eduardo's speed is on the fast side of the spectrum but sometimes it does not feel consistent or predictable.
In some moments he takes a bit more time than needed for a simple task,
in others a task that may look like big one ends faster than a small one.

In my opinion since we dropped the scheduled support rotation, i have seen a shy participation on the community from Eduardo,
i feel he is a knowledgeable individual and should participate  more on the community.

1 being idle, 10 being autonomous

**Detailed Description Identification as a Self Starter With an Active Contribution Mindset**

Rate this peer as a Self Starter. Justify your rating above.

This is an interesting point i guess i see Eduardo as person with an active contribution mindset
 but when it comes to execution of the task that he could have proposed it is possible that the level of motivation
 to get it done is not there anymore or have changed.

**Numerical Rating of Communication Skills**

Rate this peer's communication skills. 1 being completely inadequate, 10 being highest quality

[9]

**Detailed Description of Communication Skills**

Rate this peer's communication skills. Justify your rating above.

Eduardo's communication skills is of really good quality,
he communicates clearly and makes sure his message is understood,
however in a remote environment with async elements and the equivalent of the listening part of the communication,
takes a point away from the rating as sometimes knowing if your message have reached or was understood by him is a bit difficult.

[10]

**Detailed Description of Identification as a Pocket Network Organization Member**

Eduardo is an active and engaged organization member, always eager to contribute and help ,

**Numerical Rating of Leadership Qualities**

[7]

**Detailed Description of Leadership Qualities**

Rate this peer as a Leader. Justify your rating above.

I believe Eduardo leadership qualities are hidden behind some sudden motivation swings,
like if he is really invested on a Project, you will see him rallying the guys to get things done,
but if he is faced with some constrains that reduce the amount of motivation or interest in doing something,
you will see the leadership qualities fade.

Rate this peer's knowledge outside their specialty. 1 being an isolated specialist, 10 being a well-rounded specialist

[9]

**Detailed Description of Non-Specialty Knowledge**

Rate this peer's knowledge outside their specialty. Justify your rating above.

From what I have seen, Eduardo has good knowledge outside the area of speciality,
helping and participating in discussion on various topics like frontend frameworks, docker/kubernetes and testing suites.
Effectively helping the team with his knowledge.
