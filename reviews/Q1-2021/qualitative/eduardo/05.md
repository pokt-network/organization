Rate the quality of the work delivered by this peer. 1 being the lowest quality and 10 being the highest quality.

**Detailed Description Rating of Quality Of Work** 

Rate the quality of the work delivered by this peer. Justify your rating above.

Eduardo's work was not bad quality. Sometimes his PR's needed more work and occasionally even rejected. The code typically passed Circle CI and seemed to mostly satisfy the requirement. Eduardo could improve on the level of attention to the prompt and take more care with the deliverables presented. It seems like sometimes he doesn't understand the issue and what exactly needs to be fixed.  

**Numerical Rating of Speed Of Work** 

Rate the speed of the work delivered by this peer. 1 being very slow and 10 being very fast.

**Detailed Description Rating of Speed Of Work** 

Rate the speed of the work delivered by this peer. Justify your rating above.

In the last quarter, Eduardo's deliverables were slow. Though speed isn't everything, I don't think he was working his 100% on everything he did and it will likely be reflected in the quantitive analysis.

**Numerical Rating of Identification as a Community Member** 

Rate this peer as a Community Member. 1 being barely a community member and 10 being the highest quality community member.

**Detailed Description Identification as a Community Member** 

Rate this peer as a Community Member. Justify your rating above.

I haven't seen Eduardo participate in support in a while so I did a search in the #node-runner channel and was very disappointed with the results. In the last quarter he messaged 1 time. Granted a lot of support and community efforts are done via DMs but to my knowledge this is the extent of his participation as a community member. In total his public/private messages totaled to 12 messages and most were in #Random.

**Numerical Rating of Identification as a Self Starter With an Active Contribution Mindset** 

Rate this peer as a Self Starter (a person who is sufficiently motivated or ambitious to work without the help of others).
1 being idle, 10 being autonomous

**Detailed Description Identification as a Self Starter With an Active Contribution Mindset** 

Rate this peer as a Self Starter. Justify your rating above.

Especially in the last quarter I have not been impressed with Eduardo's ability to complete tasks proactively. He could certainly improve in this area and I've seen him be much more active in the past.

**Numerical Rating of Communication Skills** 

Rate this peer's communication skills. 1 being completely inadequate, 10 being highest quality

8

**Detailed Description of Communication Skills** 

Rate this peer's communication skills. Justify your rating above.

Eduardo is a good communicator. He speaks eloquently and when he talks, people listen. He has an opportunity to change minds and when he expresses himself it shines through.

**Numerical Rating of Identification as a Pocket Network Organization Member** 

Rate this peer as a Pocket Network Organization Member. 1 being a non-participant, 10 being very active and engaged.

Rate this peer as a Pocket Network Organization Member. Justify your rating above

Edu did a pretty good job in developing organizational level processes. He stepped up several times to express himself clearly and thoroughly. However, I did not see good participation in the organization repo. There is improvement to be made on that front.

**Numerical Rating of Leadership Qualities** 

Rate this peer as a Leader. 1 being a follower, 10 being a true captain.

4

**Detailed Description of Leadership Qualities** 

Rate this peer as a Leader. Justify your rating above.

Edu is able to be a leader, but I didn't really see it much the last quarter. I saw him lead the march on a discussion post, but that's about as much as I can say at this point.

**Numerical Rating of Non-Specialty Knowledge** 

Rate this peer's knowledge outside their specialty. 1 being an isolated specialist, 10 being a well-rounded specialist

8

**Detailed Description of Non-Specialty Knowledge** 

Rate this peer's knowledge outside their specialty. Justify your rating above.

I think Edu's knowledge outside of his specialty is above average. He seems knowledgable of infra technologies (docker) and overall seems to be programmatically multilingual. There's always more to learn, especially with the client side tooling.



### General Notes
Eduardo has great potential, I don't think this was his best quarter. There's a lot of room for improvement and I'd love to see a turnaround.
