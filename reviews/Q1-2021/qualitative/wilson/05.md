It's a two way street, however it seems like Nelson works pretty strictly with the infra specialists. I'd look forward to more cross-pollination in the future.

I know a bit of JS, Wilson knows how to deliver high quality code. I think he's more than capable of delivering gold standard code. However, the documentation deliverables were far less than desirable.

On the milestone I collaborated with Wilson on, the deliverables were both high stakes and very late. I was not impressed with the pace of app solutions this quarter.

Wilson does not participate publicly in the discord AFAIK. He has a lot to say but doesn't seem to share it with the community in a meaningful way.

Wilson seems to be motivated to learn, I've seen him seek further education to try to understand the project better. I don't think he looks for ways to actively ensure the success of the company and the project, I'd like to see more of this.

1 on 1, he can communicate very well. He has good ideas so I wish he'd speak up more in a group setting.

He had some good ideas during the brainstorming parts at the beginning of the quarter, but I saw little to no follow through on the practices of the organization. I'd like to see some improvement here.

**Detailed Description of Leadership Qualities**

Wilson does not seem to lead in the work I've done with him. Since he's so smart, I'd like for him to put more of an effort to step up and become the future of the organization.

Wilson did not demonstrate any knowledge outside his specialty, I'd like for him to prove me wrong next quarter.
