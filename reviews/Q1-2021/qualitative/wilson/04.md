I have not seen Wilson engaging with the community directly in any way. I think there is room for improvement there as he

that could need a hand from the guys that are working directly with the original Client/SDK.

Wilson doesn't communicates a lot. His communication is sufficient but not more. I will like to see Wilson communicate more with other peers, sometimes i would like to hear from him in other topics

In line with the previous rating Wilson's brief communication, hinder his Identification as a active pocket organization member,
he speaks his mind only when needed but when he decides to do so he always brings interesting and valid elements to the conversations.

I will rate Wilson in the lower side of the spectrum as i have not seen much leadership qualities from him.
This may be because Wilson doesn't participate much in the day by day discussions or calls.
