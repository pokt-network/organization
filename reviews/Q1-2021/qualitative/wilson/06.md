## Review

Wilson's work on the RC-0.6.0 release led to a delay in the release, and emergency work by Andrew and Luis to support the release.

**Numerical Rating of Speed Of Work** 

[5]

**Detailed Description Rating of Speed Of Work** 

Work done by Wilson on the RC-0.6.0 release was "code complete" on time, but wasn't properly tested leading up to delays in delivery of the milestone.

**Numerical Rating of Identification as a Community Member**

**Detailed Description Identification as a Community Member** 

Wilson's participation in the community is extremely rare, and it's usually prompted by someone else asking him to participate.

**Numerical Rating of Identification as a Self Starter With an Active Contribution Mindset** 

[1]

**Detailed Description Identification as a Self Starter With an Active Contribution Mindset** 

Wilson has not self-started any efforts during the quarter, all his work was assigned and brainstormed in groups by others.

**Numerical Rating of Communication Skills** 

[5]

**Detailed Description of Communication Skills** 

Wilson is very shy to speak up and rarely participates in meetings unless prompted. When he participates he's usually very concise and clear.

**Numerical Rating of Identification as a Pocket Network Organization Member** 

[3]

**Detailed Description of Identification as a Pocket Network Organization Member** 

Wilson shows little interest in the organization and has rarely provided feedback, only when pressed to do so.

**Numerical Rating of Leadership Qualities** 

[4]

**Detailed Description of Leadership Qualities** 

Wilson can lead within his specialty, after requirements are given to him, to push through an implementation, however shows little interest in leadership of large projects.

**Numerical Rating of Non-Specialty Knowledge** 

[3]

**Detailed Description of Non-Specialty Knowledge** 

Wilson is often times needed to be explained basic features of the system, both from the core client and infrastructure standpoints, which I believe limits his approach to the work he does within his own specialty.

### General Notes
Wilson has great knowledge of application development and software engineering, however he often times goes periods of time just working on projects he's assigned and not trying to push the envelope forward within his own specialty, very rarely participating or providing opinions on other specialties work.
