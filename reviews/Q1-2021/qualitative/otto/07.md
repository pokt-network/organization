**Numerical Rating of Identification as a Community Member** 

[9]

**Detailed Description Identification as a Community Member** 

Otto participates in community dicussions and provides support for Node Runners often when issues arise, providing insights and recommendations on their setups. What Otto could improve a little bit is communicate with the community from the position of a subject-matter expert.

**Numerical Rating of Identification as a Self Starter With an Active Contribution Mindset** 

[8]

**Detailed Description Identification as a Self Starter With an Active Contribution Mindset** 

Otto is definitely a self starter, specially on the QA front, where he's always finding new ways of testing the software and putting it through it's paces by continously running multiple scenarios and configurations. Otto also participates in discussions and helps in the brainstorming processes, what I think Otto is lacking is following through with his ideas and pushing them all the way up to being implemented.

**Numerical Rating of Communication Skills** 

[10]

**Detailed Description of Communication Skills** 

Otto's communication style is well paced, measured and insightful. He's always on-point with his comments and very relatable and easy to talk to.

**Numerical Rating of Identification as a Pocket Network Organization Member** 

[8]

**Detailed Description of Identification as a Pocket Network Organization Member** 

Otto demonstrates interest in everything in the organization, and usually expresses his opinions and feedbacks on what works and what doesn't from his point of view. What sometimes I think happens is that he expresses or acts as if he were a third party to the organization and is quick to desist when encountered with resistance on ideas.

**Numerical Rating of Leadership Qualities** 

[5]

**Detailed Description of Leadership Qualities** 

I think Otto has all the qualities to be a great leader of the organization, however 2 behaviours come to mind that might be stopping him from being a leader:

1. Being more assertive with his ideas and pushing them to fruition.
2. Taking ownership over larger coordination efforts such as projects and milestones, instead of playing more of a support role.

**Numerical Rating of Non-Specialty Knowledge** 

[9]

**Detailed Description of Non-Specialty Knowledge** 

Otto is a pretty well rounded specialist, from infrastructure knowledge to client side development and QA.

### General Notes
Otto can be a great asset to the organization if he can step up more often as a leader.
