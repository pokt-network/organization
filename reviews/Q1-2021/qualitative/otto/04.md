9

**Detailed Description Rating of Quality Of Work** 

Rate the quality of the work delivered by this peer. Justify your rating above.

Otto's work was a very good quality. This peer's PR's were scarcely ever rejected. The code typically passed Circle CI and always seemed to satisfy the requirement. Otto knows how to deliver quality code. I gave a 9 because the QA standard of his code isn't a 'Gold Standard', could be improved with more unit/behavioral tests.

**Numerical Rating of Speed Of Work** 

Rate the speed of the work delivered by this peer. 1 being very slow and 10 being very fast.
10

In many occasions I have seen Otto deliver work very quickly. He seems to always know how to toe the line between urgent delivery and intelligent execution. I've scarcely been blocked by him and when assigned any task he seems to deliver.

Rate this peer as a Community Member. 1 being barely a community member and 10 being the highest quality community member.

I've seen Otto reach out sometimes. It's not very often, but when he does provide support or insight to the community in Discord it's of the highest quality. I would say Otto could be more active on this front.

**Numerical Rating of Identification as a Self Starter With an Active Contribution Mindset** 

Rate this peer as a Self Starter (a person who is sufficiently motivated or ambitious to work without the help of others).
1 being idle, 10 being autonomous

Otto has grown a lot in the past year. Before I would have said Otto was not actively engaged in looking for ways to improve this company and vision. However, these days he's a great contributor and a proactive person. I've personally seen him catch things just by going the extra mile. I give Otto an 8 because I still think he can push himself more and there's more potential to be accessed.

**Numerical Rating of Communication Skills** 

Rate this peer's communication skills. 1 being completely inadequate, 10 being highest quality

**Detailed Description of Communication Skills**

Otto is able to communicate himself well. I think he's adequate on this front but not outstanding. I think he could sometimes demonstrate his points in a more digestible fashion by providing clear examples (he does this quite well).

**Numerical Rating of Identification as a Pocket Network Organization Member** 

Rate this peer as a Pocket Network Organization Member. 1 being a non-participant, 10 being very active and engaged.

Otto is a good contributor to the organization with his ideas. He was also a good participant during the organization framework development. I've seen mild participation in the organization repo / discussion platforms / brainstorming hours. There could be some improvement there.

**Numerical Rating of Leadership Qualities** 

Rate this peer as a Leader. 1 being a follower, 10 being a true captain.

Otto really stepped up this last quarter. I've seen big changes in his ability to speak his mind and lead projects and tasks. I gave an 8 because I think he can still give more, he's got a bright future.

**Numerical Rating of Non-Specialty Knowledge** 

Rate this peer's knowledge outside their specialty. 1 being an isolated specialist, 10 being a well-rounded specialist

8

**Detailed Description of Non-Specialty Knowledge** 

Rate this peer's knowledge outside their specialty. Justify your rating above.

I think Otto's knowledge outside of his specialty is above average. He seems quite knowledgable of infra technologies as well as understands the security aspects not native to the protocol. I think Otto could improve his knowledge of the JS tools a bit more.



### General Notes
Overall, I was very impressed with Otto this quarter and hope he will use this feedback to improve next quarter
